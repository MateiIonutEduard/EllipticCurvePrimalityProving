## Description
Fast enough proves if the odd integer is true prime number or is composite number.<br>
For this application I has built three libraries that provides even faster arithmetic <br> operations to test the primality of large integers numbers.

## Dependencies
Project is created with these libraries: <br>
Eduard.dll<br>
Eduard.Cryptography.dll<br>
Eduard.Foundation.dll<br>
WPF user interface, rendered using <b>DirectX</b><br>

## Setup
To run this project, install it using Visual Studio:

Extract archve to <b>Elliptic Curve Primality Proving/</b> folder<br>
Open <b>Elliptic Curve Primality Proving.sln</b> in Visual Studio<br>
Select Build > <b>Build Solution<b>
